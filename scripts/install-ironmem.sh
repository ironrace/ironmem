# install-ironmem.sh — atomically install the ironmem binary to ~/.ironrace/bin/
#
# Why this script exists: plain `cp` overwrites bytes in place, same inode.
# macOS lets that happen even while an `ironmem serve` process is actively
# executing the file; the write corrupts the running code page and any new
# invocation loading the same inode silently hangs or exits. Using install(1)
# unlinks the old file and creates a new one, so running processes keep their
# old copy and new invocations get a clean binary.
#
# The script builds release (unless --skip-build), then atomically replaces
# ~/.ironrace/bin/ironmem and verifies the resulting binary runs.
